    short: 'The towering figure of Digambara Jain philosophy. His Samayasara is the most influential text in the tradition.',
    long: 'Acharya Kundakunda is quoted constantly in every later Digambara commentary. His works lay out the entire Digambara philosophy of the soul (jīva) using the methodologically powerful niścaya–vyavahāra distinction (absolute vs. conventional standpoints). Almost nothing is preserved about his historical life; the texts have carried him for nearly two millennia.',

    significance: 'Kundakunda\'s niścaya–vyavahāra method shapes nearly all subsequent Digambara philosophy. The Samayasara is read by monks, ascetics, and serious lay students continuously across the centuries; it is the philosophical core of the tradition.',

    nameSk: 'आचार्य उमास्वामी',
    era: 'c. 2nd–4th century CE',
    short: 'Author of the Tattvartha Sutra — the rare Jain scripture accepted as authoritative by both Digambara and Shvetambara traditions.',
    long: 'Sometimes called Umaswati in the Shvetambara tradition. Almost nothing is preserved about his life. What survives is the Tattvartha Sutra — 357 highly compressed Sanskrit sutras across 10 chapters that condense the entire Jain worldview into the most aphoristic form possible. Each sutra is just a few words; each opens onto centuries of commentary.',

    significance: 'The Tattvartha is the philosophical DNA of Jainism — the one text every educated Jain knows. Both traditions treat it as authoritative, despite reading it through different commentarial lineages (Sarvarthasiddhi for Digambara; Tattvartha-bhāṣya for Shvetambara).',

    long: 'Pujyapada\'s Sarvarthasiddhi establishes the authoritative Digambara reading of the Tattvartha Sutra. When doctrinal questions about Tattvartha arise, the Sarvarthasiddhi resolves them; this library cites it constantly. He also composed the Ishtopadesh — 51 meditative Sanskrit verses — and the Samadhitantra. Pujyapada was renowned as a scholar of Sanskrit grammar (Jainendra-vyākaraṇa) as well as philosophy.',

    significance: 'For Digambara philosophy, the Sarvarthasiddhi is what gives the Tattvartha Sutra its detailed teeth. Without Pujyapada\'s reading, the Tattvartha would be a skeleton; with it, it becomes a living philosophical system.',

    long: 'Samantabhadra is one of the earliest Digambara philosophical writers; tradition places him after Umaswami and before Pujyapada, and he builds on Kundakunda\'s two-standpoint (naya) framework. His Aapta-mīmāṁsā argues philosophically for what makes a teacher trustworthy — the apta — establishing categories that later commentators build on extensively. The Ratnakaranda Shravakachara codifies lay practice in 150 verses and is still recited.',

    long: 'Almost nothing is preserved of Manatunga\'s historical life. What survives is the Bhaktamara Stotra: 48 verses (Digambara recension; 44 in Shvetambara) of remarkable Sanskrit poetry, dense with imagery, technically masterful, devotionally profound. The famous legend — that Manatunga composed the stotra while bound in 48 chains by King Bhoja, with each verse breaking one chain — comes from medieval sources written centuries after him and varies across traditions (Shvetambara accounts count 44). King Bhoja of Dhara ruled in the 11th century, long after Manatunga.',

    long: 'Pt. Daulatram was a 19th-century Hindi poet-pandit of the Palliwal Jain community, born at Sasni near Aligarh (Hathras). He is a different person from the 18th-century Jaipur author Pt. Daulatram Kasliwal. Besides the Chhah Dhala he composed many prayers and devotional verses that are recited in Jain temples. The Chhah Dhala — "six sections" — distills the Jain path into accessible Hindi-language verse, making it readable for ordinary householders without Sanskrit training. It became, and remains, the most widely-read Digambara text in modern North India.',
